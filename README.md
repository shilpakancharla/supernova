# Computational Supernovae Neutrino Model

In order to use this program, please create two folders in the same directory where you save main.ipynb (or main.py) called "data" and "spectra." This will allow you to obtain the data file (described below) and the spectra from the run. The data file has seven columns, set up from left to right as:

1) ## Energy

2) ## flux_e: Flux of electron neutrinos

3) flux_anti_e: Flux of electron antineutrinos

4) flux_mu: Flux of mu neutrinos

5) flux_anti_mu: Flux of mu antineutrinos

6) flux_tau: Flux of tau neutrino

7) flux_anti_tau: Flux of tau antineutrinos
